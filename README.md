Front-End Architecture (Angular)
The front-end of the application is structured using Angular's component-based architecture. Different components are created for various UI elements, such as login, signup, project list view, project proposal, etc. Each component represents a specific part of the application's user interface.

Angular services are used to manage data and perform actions that are shared across multiple components. Services handle interactions with the backend, such as retrieving project data, submitting project choices, and user authentication. Services ensure separation of concerns and reusable code.

Angular pipes are used for data transformation and formatting. Pipes are used to format dates, display user-friendly text, and filter project lists based on various criteria.
